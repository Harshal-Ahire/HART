# Overview
HART (Heart Attack Risk Tracker), This project provides a web-based application to predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning models. The application leverages a Logistic Regression model to classify individuals into two categories: high risk or low risk of heart disease based on various medical features.

# Features
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive web form to input medical features related to heart health.
Heart Disease Prediction: The model predicts whether a person is at low or high risk of heart disease based on their input.
Machine Learning Model: A Logistic Regression model that classifies heart disease risk using medical data.
Scalable Architecture: The system is designed to be easily expandable, allowing for the addition of more features or different models in the future.

# Technologies Used
Flask: A Python web framework to build the web application.
Joblib: Used to load pre-trained models, scaler, and label encoder.
NumPy: For numerical operations, including scaling the input data.
HTML: For designing the front-end interface and ensuring a user-friendly experience.

# Dataset
The model is trained on the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains various features, such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate, chest pain type, exercise-induced angina, and other medical factors, which are used to predict the presence of heart disease.

You can access the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset
