## **About**
- End-to-end **web app for heart disease risk prediction** using a **Logistic Regression model** built with Flask.  
- Classifies individuals into **high/low heart disease risk** categories based on multiple medical parameters.  
- Uses the **Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset** containing **1028 samples** with clinical and lifestyle-related attributes.  
- Includes **data preprocessing** (scaling and encoding) for accurate and consistent predictions.

| **Train/Test Split**           | 80/20                                                                      |
| **Evaluation Metrics**         | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC                              |
| **Train Accuracy**             | 85%                                                                         |
| **Test Accuracy**              | 80%                                                                         |
| **Cross-Validation Accuracy**  | 81.3% (5-fold CV on training set)                                          |
| **ROC-AUC**                    | 0.83                                                                        |
