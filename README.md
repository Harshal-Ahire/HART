Heart Disease Classification This project provides a web-based application to predict the risk of heart disease using machine learning models. The model classifies individuals into two categories: high or low risk of heart disease based on a set of medical features. 
The web interface is built using Flask, allowing users to input their data and receive a prediction on their heart disease risk. Features User-friendly interface: Simple web form to input medical features related to heart health. Heart disease prediction: The model predicts whether a person is at low or high risk of heart disease. 
Machine Learning model: Trained Logistic Regression model that classifies heart disease risk. Scalable architecture: Can be easily expanded to add more features or different models. Technologies Used Flask: A Python web framework to build the web application. Joblib: Used to load pre-trained models, scaler, and label encoder. NumPy: For numerical operations like scaling the input data. 
HTML: For designing the front-end interface. Dataset The model is trained on the Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains various features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate, chest pain type, exercise-induced angina, and other medical factors, which are used to predict the presence of heart disease. You can access the dataset here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset
