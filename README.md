## **About**
- End-to-end **web app for heart disease risk prediction** using a **Logistic Regression model** built with Flask.  
- Classifies individuals into **high/low heart disease risk** categories based on multiple medical parameters.  
- Uses the **Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset** containing clinical and lifestyle-related attributes.  
- Includes **data preprocessing** (scaling and encoding) for accurate and consistent predictions.
